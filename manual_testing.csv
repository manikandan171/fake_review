20206,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,CG,"OMG, First reason why I chose this style is because it is a nice fit for a person with a narrow foot.  The front of the shoe is slightly wider than the back, so that it is a little smaller in the heel.  The front is very soft and gives good support.  The straps are very comfortable and the material is very soft and soft.  The color is very nice and the material is very comfortable.  The only reason I didn't buy this style was because it is very short for a woman, but I am glad I did.  I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium.  The length is perfect.  The fabric is soft, but the color is very bright and vivid.  It is a cute color to wear for a costume.  I wish it had the support that I need.  I would recommend this style for anyone.I really like these shoes.  I have had a few pairs of these in the past.  They are very comfortable and are very comfortable.  I usually wear a 9.5 and these fit perfectly.  They are very comfortable and the cushioning is very nice.  I have never had a pair of these in a store and this one was on sale.  I would recommend these shoes.I ordered these in a size small and they fit perfect.  I bought them for my mom, who wears a medium.  She loves them.

20207,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,CG,"First off I returned this pair. The quality is just what I wanted, just the right amount of cushioning.  The front of the shoe is a little tight on the inside, but it's okay.  I wear a medium, and it fits perfectly.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.  I did get a size large and it fit perfectly.  I will say that I had to take a few items off.  I have a hard time finding shoes that fit me well, so I returned them.

It's not a deal breaker but it's a nice feature for the price. I don't know why it didn't make the cut. This is a good quality wallet.

20206,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"The cold damp fog tries to grab at my ankles as I make my way down the darkened alley where I stop at the doorway marked only by a flickering blue lamp. I knock softly three times; wait for two seconds and then twice again. The spy hole immediately opens and I can feel myself being visibly searched from my head to my toes. I see the eyes catch a glimpse of my Three Wolf Moon Tee shirt and then just the barest of a smile. Seconds later, I hear the sound of several dead bolts being released and I am welcomed into a vibrant room full of beautiful people. Led to my table by a beautifully tantalizing Oriental woman wearing a thigh high cut dress, I am immediately set upon by servants trying to catch a glimpse of my famously designed shirt. I cannot begin to believe my good fortune at just being admitted into the famous Che Le Torche Cabaret in Algiers. No questions asked, no cards required...Just service with a smile and almost a sense of reverence or perhaps I should say... awe. I am on my second straight tequila, when I sense the presence of someone standing at the edge of my table. A tall thin man in a while silk suit wearing a Panama hat wordlessly hands me a card with just one word on it.. ""Omar"". He asks if he might join me. I quickly judge this is a man to be reckoned with after noticing the long scar running from the edge of his mouth to his right ear.

""Why not? I reply.

Before the evening is finished I will have found not a friend, but a new business partner, who is destined to make me a very rich man.

The reason for my success?

Simple... Omar tells me that he could determine I was a man to be trusted and that he could rely upon because of my discriminating taste by owning and actually wearing a Three Wolf Moon tee shirt in public.

Life is very strange.",1
20207,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",1
20208,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

I wish I could give these sandals more than 5 stars. They're perfect. I am a very, very satisfied customer!",1
20209,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band.
I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat.
This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once.
I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like.
Please note I received this product at a free or reduced price for my honest review. The above review is my honest opinion and not hindered or influenced in any way.

20210,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size...",1

I don't get much opportunity to ""dress up"" these days, and its nice to have an inexpensive watch to have ""on reserve"" for those events where it does happen.  Typically I'm wearing my casio tough solar watch with a suit, and it doesn't look right (even if it is a good representation of ""the real me"").

Now with the Armitron I'll have an appropriate watch to wear ""occasionally"".

Its easier than taking your watch into a shop.  I live in a household of 6, so whenever anyone gets a watch I can just adjust it easily.

I think the lack of a calendar function is a huge plus.  Calendar functions never work that well, whenever you have a month that only has 30 days then your calendar is ""off"" and you have fiddle with it.  There are so many other ways for me to know the proper date, like my cell phone and my computer, that I don't need my watch to provide that information.  just the time is fine.

The fit is comfortable.  The red color is pleasing when worn with dressy or dressy casual clothing.

The negatives:
1) the presentation box arrived damaged, which if you were going to give it as a gift would be undesirable.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars:  well, to do that it would have to have something about it that I thought was truly excellent and made it stand out in its field. Also at the time of this review it was not clear to me what the retail price is.  This is a very nice watch, and I like it, but I don't really know how good a value it is.  I'll come back later and update it if it comes back into stock.",1
20212,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

20213,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.

UPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.

Take the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.",1

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!",1
20215,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.",1
